# BungieARGGifParser
This is a tool to help calculate a substitution cypher developed by a contributor to the Beyond Light ARG that I optimized to run faster using multi-threading.

#### Note:
*This repo is no longer being updated as the ARG (Augmented Reality Game) from bungie was solved* The solution can be viewed here. The explanation of the process of finding the solution is here I assisted in optimizing the substitution cypher to utilize multiple threads after the initial contributor developed it.
